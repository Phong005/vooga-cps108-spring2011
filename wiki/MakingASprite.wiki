#summary A Guide to Making a Sprite using the Component System in the VOOGA game engine

= Introduction =

In the VOOGA game engine, a sprite is (at the most basic level) a movable image. However, sprites can be used for many different purposes and are the essential components in designing and playing a game. Sprites serve as the core objects in any variety of game or gameplay that is in need of components beyond a frame and a background i.e. nearly every game!

=The Component System=

     The component system is, in essence, a system designed to allow dynamic exchange of qualities within an object that eliminates the need for a deep and convoluted class or interface hierarchy. The goal of the system is to allow for design of a small, shallow hierarchy that is modified at runtime by components that are placed into a buildable object. It allows for generation of a pseudo-hierarchy without restrictions such as single-class extension or having to re-implement various interface methods in only slightly different classes.

 == I. What is a component?==
     Basically, a component is anything that implements the IComponent interface. This interface contributes essential activity to a given class, making it easily modifiable through simple use of reflection and retrieval by class names. Here is the code:

{{{
 /**
     * Sets this component to the input qualities characteristics. Must be the
     * same component class
     * 
     * @param c
     */
    public abstract void setTo (IComponent c);
    
    /**
     * Sets this component to the input characteristics. Must be the
     * correct characteristics to satisfy one constructor in the component.
     * input must be in same order as constructor.
     * 
     * @param c
     */
    public abstract void setTo (Object ... args);


    public abstract boolean equals (IComponent c);
}}}
