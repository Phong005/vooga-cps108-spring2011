#summary Tutorial on how to use ResourceManager.

= Introduction =

ResourceManager is responsible for reading the central resource.xml file for each game, interpreting its contents and dispatching subparsers to load appropriate resources. 

= Syntax =

{{{
<resources>
    <images>
        <source>images.xml</source>
    </images>
    <levels>
        <level id=1>level1.xml</level>
        <level id=2>level2.xml</level>
         ....
    </levels>
</resources>
}}}

In the above example, you see that the root tag is <resources>, and it includes all other tags. <images> is the enclosing tag for image resources, and the contents of this tag define image resources.
The {{{<source>...</source>}}} tag is essentially an include directive.

== Example images.xml (from Asteroids) ==
{{{
<images>
	<image name="ship">
		<path>src/games/asteroids/resources/images/ship.gif</path>
	</image>
	<image name="bullet">
		<path>src/games/asteroids/resources/images/green_bullet.gif</path>
	</image>
	<image name="asteroid">
		<path>src/games/asteroids/resources/images/asteroid.gif</path>
	</image>
</images>
}}}
